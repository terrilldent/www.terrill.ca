<p>Last July (2013), nearly a year ago, I left RIM/BlackBerry and joined a startup in Waterloo called TrustPoint as Engineer #1. That's a big change for me. BlackBerry was (and still is, in some way) a significant part of my world.</p>

<p>I'm now building a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">Certificate Authority</a> for non-humans from the ground up. It's super challenging work, spanning a multitude of disciplines.</p>

<p>Since this blog rarely gets updated, I should mention that I'm on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/terrilldent">@terrilldent</a>.</p>
