<p>I published my <a href="/sorting/">table sorting</a> script to github over the past couple of days. It's at <a href="https://github.com/terrilldent/tsorter">terrilldent/tsorter</a>. It's vanilla JS, there are no dependencies.</p>

<p>This was an interesting exercise. It was some of the oldest javascript code I still have in my possession, originally written in summer 2006.  It's been updated to satisfy my more recent coding standards, but still functions the same way.</p>

<p>My plan is do some timing tests, and transition it to use a shadow DOM, or at least off-DOM sorting. Right now it's layout thrashing pretty hard.</p>
