<p>Still working on my secure login without HTTPs. My non-comprehensive list of desired qualities:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Never send password in a reversible encoding.</li>
    <li>Try to avoid replay attacks and session hijacking.</li>
    <li>Protect against brute force attacks on intercepted data.</li>
    <li>Protect against browser plugins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Progress is coming along nicely. The authentication and validation steps are working, which means I have a functioning system. Next I need to exercise it and make sure it works in practice.</p>
