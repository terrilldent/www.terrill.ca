<p>This is a large 30"x15" pencil crayon illustration that I'd planned to give as a christmas present but didn't quite finish in time.</p>

<p>The sky is filled with thousands of small dots that combine to make a detailed texture. Like many of my others, it is based on the work of Robert Bateman.</p>
