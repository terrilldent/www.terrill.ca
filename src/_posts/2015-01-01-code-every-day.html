<p>One of the best blog posts I read in 2014 was John Resig explaining <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/">his change in working strategy</a> for side projects, from bunched up mainly weekend work to at least a little bit every day.</p>

<p>I've struggled with the feeling of making inadequate progress.  This is something that I want to try, and I'm willing to dedicate the effort. I'll share my progress.</p>
