<p>Just flipped the public switch on the repo <a href="https://github.com/terrilldent/write">terrilldent/write</a>.</p>
 
<p>It tries to create an environment with strong authenticity and integrity - but does not provide confidentiality. It's not done yet, but I want to work in the open.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of care to migrate an existing project to git, and finally open source it. Mostly I worry about passwords (or other sensitive info) leaking. I was thankful that people took the time to writeup their <a href="http://www.devfactor.net/2014/12/30/2375-amazon-mistake/">costly mistakes</a> this week as a reminder to us all.</p>

<p>Secondly I worry about vulnerabilities in my code that I don't know about being exposed. Extra care and humility are important when making claims about the security of your software.</p>
