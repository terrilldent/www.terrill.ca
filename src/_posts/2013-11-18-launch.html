<p>I've decided to relaunch my website. I wanted to create a space that had more room, and is easier to fit complex examples into. In that spirit I have abandoned columns and for now I'm writing static HTML.</p>
<p>The <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> page has been updated to show some of the things that I have been working on. There is a lot more in the works.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard, I recently left BlackBerry for a software startup. We work in the cryptography space. I look forward to sharing more about that soon.</p>
