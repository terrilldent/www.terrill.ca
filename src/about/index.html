<p>I'm a software developer with an entrepreneurial spirit. I enjoy building elegant solutions to challenging problems.</p>

<p>A focus of my career has been web development. I've created projects spanning many waves of web technology, including: web based

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miro.heffnertoyota">apps</a>, 
single-page websites and social networks, 
<a href="http://www.trustpointinnovation.com/">corporate websites</a>, and continual 
<a href="/projects">pet projects</a></p> 

<p>On mobile I have built 
<a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/680/">social</a> 
<a href="http://ca.blackberry.com/bbm.html">networking</a> apps, 
<a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/19435/">multi-device UI &amp; communication</a>, <a href="https://github.com/blackberry/Samples-for-Java/tree/master/Advanced%20UI">UI toolkits</a> and made significant contributions to

<p>I developed my skills in a forward looking development role at <a href='http://www.blackberry.com'>BlackBerry</a>, helping pioneer a culture of intrapreneurship and launching many successful products.</p>

<p>More recently I was engineer #1 at <a href="http://www.trustpointinnovation.com/">TrustPoint</a>, a security and cryptography startup in Waterloo. I started and built up the engineering processes, launching a new type of <a href="http://www.trustpointinnovation.com/m2m-certificate-authority/">Certificate Authority</a>, and the <a href="https://blackseal.trustpoint.ca/">BlackSeal</a> authenticity service and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trustpoint.blackseal">app</a> for physical goods. I also learned a great deal about modern public key cryptography, and real world experience building secure distributed systems from scratch.</p> 

<p>I have a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a>, and make use of it on a daily basis. I am fascinated with macro economics and what it teaches us about the world.</p>
